abstract = {This study provides a time frame for the initial trajectory of activation flow along the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams and for the initial activation of prefrontal cortex in the human. We provide evidence that this widespread system of sensory, parietal, and prefrontal areas is activated in less than 30 ms, which is considerably shorter than typically assumed in the human event-related potential (ERP) literature and is consistent with recent intracranial data from macaques. We find a mean onset latency of activity over occipital cortex (C1(e)) at 56 ms, with dorsolateral frontal cortex subsequently active by just 80 ms. Given that activity in visual sensory areas typically continues for 100-400 ms prior to motor output, this rapid system-wide activation provides a time frame for the initiation of feedback processes onto sensory areas. There is clearly sufficient time for multiple iterations of interactive processing between sensory, parietal, and frontal areas during brief (e.g., 200 ms) periods of information processing preceding motor output. High-density electrical mapping also suggested activation in dorsal stream areas preceding ventral stream areas. Our data suggest that multiple visual generators are active in the latency range of the traditional C1 component of the ERP, which has often been taken to represent V1 activity alone. Based on the temporal pattern of activation shown in primate recordings and the evidence from these human recordings, we propose that only the initial portion of the C1 component (approximately the first 10-15 ms; C1(e)) is likely to represent a response that is predominated by V1 activity. These data strongly suggest that activity represented in the "early" ERP components such as P1 and N1 (and possibly even C1) is likely to reflect relatively late processing, after the initial volley of sensory afference through the visual system and involving top-down influences from parietal and frontal regions.},

@article{Saron2001,
abstract = {Studies in primates have found visually responsive neurons that are distributed beyond cortical areas typically described as directly involved in vision. Among these areas are premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal eye fields. Given these findings, visual stimulation would be expected to result in activation of human frontal cortex. However, few human studies have described sensory activations in frontal regions in response to simple visual stimulation. Such studies have classically described event-related potential (ERP) components over occipital regions. The present study sought to further characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of visually-evoked electrocortical responses elicited by simple visual stimuli using scalp current density measures derived from high-density ERP recordings, with particular emphasis on the distribution of stimulus-related activity over frontal cortex. Hemiretinal stimuli were viewed passively and during a simple ipsi- or contramanual (RT) task. The motor requirement was included to investigate the effects of response preparation on premovement frontal activations. The results indicate early frontocentral activation, particularly over the right hemisphere (peak magnitude 124-148 ms) that is independent of input visual field or motor response requirement, and that is clearly separate in timecourse from the posterior responses elicited by visual input. These findings are in accord with the multiplicity of visual inputs to frontal cortex and are discussed in terms of frontal lobe functions as may be required in these tasks. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
